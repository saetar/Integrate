This is a project that I started Winter break 2014 just to occupy my time. 
It is an integrator that uses Reimann sums to evaluate expressions given as a string.

TO USE:
This is just a command-line program, so  instructions will be printed.
So far, this program should be able to handle expressions of the form of a polynomial, 
log function and trig functions.
